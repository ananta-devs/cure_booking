                    <p>The AI system has undergone extensive testing and validation in collaboration with leading medical institutions. A clinical study involving 10,000 cases showed that the AI symptom checker achieved an 85% accuracy rate in identifying the correct medical specialty needed for treatment.</p>
                    
                    <div class="quote">

It's particularly valuable in areas with limited access to healthcare professionals," noted Dr. Meera Krishnan, Head of Clinical Research.
